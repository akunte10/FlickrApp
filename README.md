# 📸 Image Gallery App (Pexels API)

A visually stunning iOS Image Gallery application built using **UIKit**, fetching and displaying images via the **Pexels API**  
This project showcases a solid grasp of **iOS fundamentals**, including **networking**, **MVVM architecture**, **image caching**, and **custom UI design** — all done **without third-party libraries**.

> 💡 Note: This app is implemented in **UIKit**, but I can seamlessly build and optimize the same experience using **SwiftUI** as well.
